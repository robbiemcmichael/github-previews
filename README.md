# github-previews

A library for [API previews](https://developer.github.com/v3/previews/) from
GitHub's REST API v3. A word of caution: GitHub have stated that API previews
are not stable and may change without notice during the review period.

This is intended to supplement the
[github](https://github.com/phadej/github) library and should follow
the standards set there wherever possible. As the API previews are promoted to
the official GitHub API they should be moved to the github library.
